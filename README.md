# ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡­ Forecasting Thailands's CO2 emission ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡­
Welcome eveyone to the challenge on Forecasting Thailands's CO2 emission. This challenge is about building a time-series model to predict the CO2 emission in various sources, such as transport, industry, and others. The objective of this tutorial is to supervised the beginner data-scientists by providing a set of recommended workflows in this challenge, such as data-preprocessing, modelling, and submission. We want to highlihght that though the provided data-preprocessing and modelling techniques give reasonable performance, participants must explore other approaches to further improve the results.
